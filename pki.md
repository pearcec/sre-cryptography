# PKI

Public-key cryptography also know as asymmetric cryptography is the method of exchanging secret material in the open without previously exchanging a shared key (symmetric).  In order for this form of cryptography to work on the Internet, some form of trust needs to be established as well as previously agreed upon formats and protocols.  PKI loosely translates to the roads and bridges necessary to make this cryptography work.

A PKI usually refers to following

* a generic reference to all things Public Key cryptography
* software installed by an organization for private needs (sometimes Certificate Authority)
* the working standards in use on the Internet
